# Databricks-Generative AI 

### Prompting, RAG, Fine-tuning, Pre-training on Databricks 
Prompt engineering is the practice of customizing prompts to elicit better responses without changing the underlying model. 
RAG finds data/documents that are relevant to a question or task and provides them as context for the LLM to give more relevant responses. 
Fine-tuning adapts an existing general-purpose LLM model by doing additional training 
Pretraining is the practice of building a new LLM model from scratch to ensure the foundational knowledge of the model is tailored to your specific domain.

### Mosaic AI Model Training
Mosaic AI Model Training can fine-tune smaller open source GenAI LLMs to produce highly efficient models that can be served up to 5x more cost-effectively than larger proprietary LLMs. Additionally, you can build new LLMs from scratch using an optimized software stack that makes training LLMs cost-effective. A combination of system-level optimizations, tuned parallelism strategies and model training science results in a 10x lower cost of training.

### Prompting & evaluating : chat with supported LLMs using AI Playground
You can interact with supported large language models using the AI Playground. The AI Playground is a chat-like environment where you can test, prompt, and compare LLMs.

### DBRX open source 
Databricks introduces DBRX, an open-source LLM that outperforms existing open-source models on standard benchmarks.
DBRX uses a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture for high efficiency and speed, with 132 billion parameters, customizable for enterprise tasks.
Enterprises like NASDAQ and JetBlue leverage the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform for high-quality AI applications.
